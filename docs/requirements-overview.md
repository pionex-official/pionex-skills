#### Skill: pionex-earn-dual
**Status:** Planned (CLI implementation pending in `pionex-ai-kit#16`)
**Scope:** Dual Investment product lifecycle — public queries require no auth; write operations require `Earn` permission

Public (no auth):
- 📋 `earn dual symbols` — List supported trading pairs with min/max investment amounts
- 📋 `earn dual open_products` — List open products for a pair and type (DUAL_BASE / DUAL_CURRENCY)
- 📋 `earn dual prices` — Get current yield rate and investability per product ID
- 📋 `earn dual index` — Real-time index price for a pair
- 📋 `earn dual delivery_prices` — Historical settlement delivery prices

Private (View permission):
- 📋 `earn dual balances` — User's dual investment account balances
- 📋 `earn dual get_invests` — Batch query investment orders by client IDs
- 📋 `earn dual records` — Paginated investment history

Private (Earn permission):
- 📋 `earn dual invest` — Create a new investment order (requires fresh `profit` from `/prices`)
- 📋 `earn dual revoke_invest` — Revoke a pending investment order
- 📋 `earn dual collect` — Collect settled earnings into spot account

### Cross-Cutting Requirements

- ✅ All write operations support `--dry-run` flag
- ✅ Skills encode explicit safety rules (no guessing params, confirm before write)
- ✅ Skills define routing to prevent overlap between skill scopes
- ✅ Skills installable via `npx skills add pionex-official/pionex-skills`

## Acceptance Criteria

Each skill must:
1. Define clear routing (`description` frontmatter) so the skill router picks the right skill
2. Document all CLI commands with exact syntax in a command table
3. Include safety rules for any write operations
4. Include `--dry-run` instructions for destructive commands
